# Stock_prediction_Amazon_TASK1
In this project I basically predicted the stock data of Amazon of next 30 days using LSTM model of Deep learning 
This project is fully done on jupyter notebook using Python languange only. 
It aims for stock forecasting by using long-short term memory(LSTM) model. I have done a in depth stock prediction of the Amazon stock dataset for next 30 days from the last date as uploaded in dataset.
Main Points done in this Project are as follows:- 1) Collected the stock data as AMZN.
                                                  2) Preprocessed the Data i.e Dividing into training(80%) and testing(20%) sets
                                                  3) Created a Stack LSTM model.
                                                  4) Predicted the test data and plotted the output.
                                                  5) In the end, predicted the future 30 days stock (open and close) price and plotted the same.
